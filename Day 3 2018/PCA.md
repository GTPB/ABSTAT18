Consider the iris dataset (included with R) which gives the petal
width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length and species for 150
irises. To view more information about the dataset, enter
help(iris).


**1** Wich are the variables that you can use for PCA?

Just the quantitative ones: petal width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length

**2.** Plot the data and analyze the correlation between the variables.

**3.** Are you going to use the covariance or the correlation matrix to do your PCA analysis?

The covariance matrix, because the data are on the same units.

**4.** What do you need to do on your data? Center or standardize?

Just center, because the variables are on the same units.

**5.** Compute the variance or correlation matrix acoordingly the data conditions.

**6.** Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on the covariance/correlation matrix.

**7.** Get the scree plot and decide how many PC do you want to keep.

**8.** Plot the Biplot for variables and cases on the same plot.

**9.** Add different colors for the different species.

**9.** Do PCA analysis using princomp() or prcomp() fucntions.
