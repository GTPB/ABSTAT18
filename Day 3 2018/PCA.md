Consider the iris dataset (included with R) which gives the petal
width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length and species for 150
irises. To view more information about the dataset, enter
help(iris).


**1** Wich are the variables that you can use for PCA?

<details><summary>Click Here to see the answer</summary><p>

Just the quantitative ones: petal width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length

**2.** Plot the data and analyze the correlation between the variables.

**3.** Are you going to use the covariance or the correlation matrix to do your PCA analysis?

<details><summary>Click Here to see the answer</summary><p>

The covariance matrix, because the data are on the same units.

**4.** What do you need to do on your data? Center or standardize?

<details><summary>Click Here to see the answer</summary><p>

Just center, because the variables are on the same units.

**5.** Compute the variance or correlation matrix acoordingly the data conditions.
