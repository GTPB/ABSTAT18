**Lisete Sousa** is an Associate Professor in Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL) and coordinates the Centre of Statistics and Applications (CEAUL) since January 2017.

She obtained her PhD in Probability and Statistics (Lisbon University and Dortmund University - Germany) in 2004, and since then she has taught the course Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics in the University of Lisbon, among other statistical courses for BSc. and MSc. Her main research interests are the development of statistical methodologies for detecting differentially expressed genes, and the prediction of transmembrane proteins topology based on hidden Markov models but adopting a Bayesian perspective.

She coordinated the MSc in Biostatistics at FCUL, from 2009 to 2016, and collaborates with researchers from the Institute of Molecular Medicine (IMM-FMUL) and from the Center for Biodiversity, Functional and Integrative Genomics (BioFIG-FCUL) in the development of statistical methods for the analysis of Microarray and RNA-Seq data. She has been a GTPB instructor in the BFB course in 2010 and 2012, and the ABSTAT course in 2014 and 2017.
